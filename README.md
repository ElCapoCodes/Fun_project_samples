<h1>Private Project Samples</h1>
<p>The list in this repository are script samples where some are for fun activities while others have more serious intent, but all in this list are or have been used on my private life.</p>

<p>Most output files go thru post-processing for cosmetic
purposes prior to be used (i.e., published). In addition, scripts have been
modified to protect privacy.</p>
